\accf{Gold Saucer} is an amusement park with a wide variety of games and attractions for the player characters to enjoy and compete in.
You can either use the entire park as a location in your game world or just pick out attractions that you are particularly interested in.
As such, the following content is mostly a list of park attractions with their respective rules.
Gold Saucer is built as high tower surrounded by multiple large structures that contain the different attractions.
The park's entrance can only be reached with a cable car, the entry fee of 50G per person includes the fare.
Alternatively, players can buy a lifetime pass for 500G.
Also, taking part in an attraction usually costs an amount of Gold Points (GP), which is the only accepted currency inside the park.
GP can be bought and sold at the park's entrance at a rate of 1 GP per 50G.
Right behind the entrance, the players find themselves in a central hub, from which they can move between the major locations of the park through a series of tubes.

This document focuses on the major attractions of the park and offers detailed rules for recreating them in your game.
In contrast, there are also many minor attractions of Gold Saucer, some of which are listed below: \ofrow
\ofbullet{\accf{Fortune Teller:} a strange being that looks like a big plush toy with a cat sitting on top of it. It offers a fortune telling to the party for the cost of 2 GP, a service which they can only use once. The GM should ensure that the teller gives the party an accurate prediction or a useful advice for the future.}
\ofbullet{\accf{Gondola:} for a price of 1 GP per person, the party can take a ride on a big gondala, which allows them to catch a nice view of the whole park at its zenith. If the players enter the gondola at midnight, they can also observe the daily fireworks of Gold Saucer. The perfect spot for a date!}
\ofbullet{\accf{Haunted House:} a creepy castle that has been prepared to scare its visitors through the placement of fake props such as ghosts, skelletons and spiders. Upon entering the first time, every player has to perform a DC~8 check and upon failure he becomes scared or creeped out. The haunted house acts as a hotel, the party can spend the night here for a price of 1 GP per person.}

The \accf{Shooting Coaster} is a roller coaster game with an entry fee of 1 GP per person.
Each seat has a turret built in that visitors can use to shoot various projections that appear throughout the coaster ride.
Hitting a projected object grants players an amount of points and they receive prizes for reaching a high score.
The duration of the ride is split into 5 rounds. 
At the start of each round, the GM rolls an amount of dice equal to the party size plus 1 to determine which projections appear in this round. 
During each round, each player takes a turn in which they can try to shoot one of the projections of their choice.
To do so they have to pass a check, the DC depends on the type of the projection as some are faster and smaller and thus harder to hit than others. 
However, projections that are harder to hit also grant more points.
Characters that can use Bows or Guns or have other experiences with ranged weapons, gain Advantage on this check.
Projections disappear either after they are successfully hit or at the end of a round.
The table below shows all possible projections, the die number (Nr.) at which they appear, the DC required to hit them and the amount of points granted when done so.

\accf{Super Dunk} is a basketball game that costs 2 GP per player to play. 
All participants stand in a dedicated spot in front of the machine and balls are given out to the players who have to successfully throw them into the hoops.
The game is played round by round, and in each one, every participant performs a throw.
A DC~6 check decides whether a throw is successful, characters with especially good coordination gain Advantage on this check.
For each successful consecutive throw, a player's prize amount is increased by 1 GP.
A player that misses a shot is immediately eliminated from the game at which point his accumulated prize amount is paid out.
After every 3 successful rounds, the players receive a Double Chance, at which point they can decide to stop and collect their prize or continue throwing.
In the latter case, a player's current prize amount is doubled if he succeeds the next throw, but if he fails, he is eliminated and receives no prize.

\accf{Arm Wrestling} is a strength competition that costs 1 GP to participate in.
The game is played by a single player who faces up to three champions, one after the other, in an arm wrestling match.
The state of a match is tracked as a scale from +3 to -3, the player wins when it reaches +3 and the opponent wins when it reaches -3.
This score is meant to represent the angle of the competitors' arms and it starts at 0.
The player and the GM who plays as the champion, make opposed checks until one side wins the match.
On each check, the score increases by 1 if the player has a higher result and it is reduced 1 if the champion has a higher roll.
Players with particularly high strength or athletic ability gain Advantage on this check and the champions gain a flat bonus due to their experience in the sport.
After defeating a champion, the total prize amount is increased and the player can decide to either stop and collect it or to challenge the next stronger champion.
In the latter case, the player gains no prize if he loses the match.
The table below lists all champions, the bonus they gain on the checks and the prizes for defeating them.

\accf{Battler} is a fighting game that costs 1 GP to play.
The game is played by a single player who faces up to four fighters, one by one, that are played by the GM.
A match is played out in multiple rounds and in each round, the combatants can choose one of 3 actions: 
low attack (LA), middle attack (MA) and high attack (HA).
The player can freely decide which action to take and then the GM rolls 1d to determine the action taken by the opponent.
HA beats LA, MA beats HA, LA beats MA and if both take the same action they just cancel each other out.
The winner of a round gains 1 point and the first one to have 3 points wins the match.
After defeating a fighter, the total prize amount is increased and the player can decide to either stop and collect it or to challenge the next stronger fighter.
In the latter case, the player gains no prize if he loses the match.

\accf{Torpedo Attack} is a submarine battle game that costs 2 GP to play. 
The game can be played by up to 3 players who can split the 3 possible submarine actions between them.
Torpedo Attack is similar to combat and the players have to defeat all enemy submarines while making sure theirs stays intact. 
A match is played out in multiple rounds and in each round, the player submarine can take 2 of the following 3 actions: \\
\ofbullet{\accf{Move:} roll 1d. The result times 10 is the amount of units you can move in this round.}\\
\ofbullet{\accf{Shoot:} choose an enemy submarine within 30u. Make a DC~7 check, if you succeed, the enemy submarine is destroyed.}\\
\ofbullet{\accf{Sonar:} make a DC~7 check, if you succeed, all mines within 50u are revealed.}\\
Enemy submarines take their actions right after the players, they can shoot in the same manner and move a distance of up to 30u, but they are not affected by mines.
The player submarine can survive up to 3 damage, getting hit by an enemy shot or moving over a mine causes 1 damage.
Use a map similar to the one below to visualize the game.

A race consists of multiple rounds and during a round, each participant performs a sprint check to determine which distance they can cover.
Participants continuously add up the results of all their checks as their total score and the first one to surpass 50 points wins the race.
The score of every participant should be announced at the end of each round to keep track of the current state of the race.
If multiple participants reach the finish line in the same round, the one with the highest score wins the race.
The sprint check performed on each turn is modified as follows:\ofrow
%
\ofbullet{%
	The result of each sprint check is reduced by the difference between the Chocobo's Stamina and its current fatigue. 
	Everyone starts with 0 fatigue and gains 1 fatigue at the end of each round.
	For example, if a Chocobo has a fatigue of 10 and a Stamina of 8, the result of their check would be reduced by 2, but if  it had 10 or more Stamina it would receive no penalty.
	This reduction cannot cause the result of a sprint to drop below 0.
}
\ofbullet{%
	Before each check, a participant can decide to perform a dash action.
	In this case, they gain Advantage on the sprint check, but also an additional point of fatigue.
	Within a race, you can dash only a maximum amount of times equal to the Chocobo's Agility.
}
\ofbullet{%
	Characters who are particularly good at handling Chocobos gain Advantage on all sprint checks.

\accf{Snow Game} is a snowboarding game that costs 1 GP to play per player.
The game can be played by multiple players who race down a ski run trying to reach a high score.
This score starts at 0, collecting balloons increases it, while hitting obstacles reduces it, so the score can become negative.
The course has 3 lanes: left, center and right and the players start on the center lane, going down the ski run back to back.
The game plays out over 7 rounds and at the start of each round, the GM rolls 3d, one die after the other, to determine the objects on the 3 lanes in front of the players from left to right.
The table below shows the possible objects based on the die results and their effects that occur when a players collide with them.

After learning about the objects in front of them, each player can decide between 1 of 3 actions:\ofrow

\ofbullet{\accf{Move two lanes to the left or right:} make a DC~8 check, if you succeed you successfully change two lanes, otherwise you stay in your current one.} 
\ofbullet{\accf{Jump:} make a DC~8 check. If you succeed, you avoid the object in front of you and you gain 1 point. If you fail, you collide with the object in front of you and you additionally lose 1 point. You can take this action even if there are no objects in front of you.} \ofrow
Characters with particularly good coordination or experience with snowboards gain Advantage on these checks.
After all actions have been taken, check which lane each player ends up in and whether they collide with any objects to adjust the scores accordingly before the next round starts.
At the end of the 7th round, all players reach the finish line and depending on their score each player receives one of the following prices.

The game plays out over 7 rounds and during each round, first all players take one turn and then all hostile bikers.
Player bikers start with 3 HP and enemy bikers start with 1 HP, when a biker is reduced to 0 HP, he is removed from the game.
During a turn, each biker may make a movement and take one Attack action:
\vfill
\ofbullet{\accf{Movement:} move either one lane to the left / right or one row to the front / back if that position is not occupied by an obstacle or another biker. Alternatively, you can try to activate the bike turbo. In this case, make a DC~8 check, if you succeed you can make two movements on this turn, if you fail, you cannot move at all. Characters with particularly good vehicle handling receive Advantage on this check}\ofpar
\ofbullet{\accf{Melee Attack:} make a DC~6 check. If you succeed, a biker who is 1 movement away from you suffers 1 HP damage.}\ofpar
\ofbullet{\accf{Ranged Attack:} make a DC~8 check. If you succeed, a biker who is 2 or less movements away from you, suffers 1 HP damage.}
%
\vfill
%
At the start of each round, roll 1d for every player that is still in the game.
Based on the results, place the following items in any open position of your choice: 1-2: nothing, 3: red biker,  4: blue biker, 5-6: obstacle.
However, do not place any more hostile bikers if there are already as many of them in the game as players.
Red and blue bikers are controlled by the GM and follow the same rules as players, but red bikers can only perform ranged attacks while blue bikers can only perform melee attacks.
Obstacles all follow the same rules and the GM is free to choose their appearance, they could for example be roadblocks or other vehicles.
Whenever a player biker ends his turn with an obstacle in the same lane in front of him, he has to make a DC~6 check, if he succeeds he jumps over the obstacle and if not, he suffers 1 HP damage.
Enemy bikers evade all obstacles automatically.
At the end of each round, all bikers stay in their positions and all obstacles disappear as they are left behind the current field of focus.
Every player biker who survives until the end of the 7th round wins a prize.
Each winner rolls 1d and depending on the result, he receives one of the following prizes.

%After defeating a group, everyone in the party can take an additional turn before the next fight starts.
%At that point, they can also decide to forfeit and collect a prize depending on how many rounds they have completed.
%If the entire party is defeated within a round, they do not receive any prize.
%In any case, the party fully recovers their HP and MP after leaving the Colosseum.  
%The list below shows the possible prizes depending on how many rounds were completed.
%The following page shows the 7 types of monsters encountered from the 1st to the 7th round.
%At the start of each round, place as many of the current round's monster type on the battlefield as there are players.
