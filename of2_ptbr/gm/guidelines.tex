The \accf{Game Master} creates the setting of the adventure and takes the role of all non-player characters.
Furthermore, the GM describes the environment around the protagonists and decides the outcomes of most actions by applying the rules of the game. 
However, unlike the players, the GM is not strictly bound by rules and may make his own rulings when necessary.
There is no single way to be a successful GM and we encourage you adopt a style that brings enjoyment to both you and the players.

Accordingly, this chapter does not focus on presenting rules or advice.
Instead, it is a collection of optional \accf{supplements}, that you can either use directly or regard as examples for creating your own content.
These supplements not only give a glimpse into the various aspects of game mastering, but also show different directions that you can take as a GM. 
The present modules can be broadly split into two categories: \accf{prepared content} and \accf{optional rules}.
The former provide you with world building blocks such as adventures, settings and monsters that are self-contained and extensible.
The latter present you examples to customize the rules to your preferences by changing or adding to existing ones.
While the prepared content is well suited for beginners, we recommend to consider optional rules once you have gathered some experience.
All available supplements are listed in the following, together with a short synopsis for each one.
