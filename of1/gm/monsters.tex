\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Monsters}%
Monsters are wild beings similar to animals, that inhabit uncivilized places in the world.
They usually have a natural habitat where they try to survive, so on contact with the party they will feel threatened and attack.
Different types of monster will generally work together against the party, though this might not always be the case.
The party might also come across more powerful and intelligent monsters with accordingly more complex goals.
Monsters are often part or cause of ongoing conflicts, so the party will be confronted with them fairly often.

\subsubsection*{Creating Monsters}
The game world that you create will usually feature various monsters, that the party will have to face during their adventure. 
You can use the following guidelines to create your own monsters.

\begin{description}[leftmargin=*]

\item[\color{accent} Context:]
When creating a monster, it is important to consider under what circumstances they will face the party.
Due to the combat rules, the side with more participants is at a great advantage, as they can take more actions per round.
Thus, powerful but outnumbered enemies will often have to make up with significantly stronger attributes and abilities.
Also, make sure to adjust the difficulty of monsters to consider your group's experience with the game.

\item[\color{accent} Attributes:]
The attributes of characters after Level 1 are distributed as follows, which you can use as a rule-of-thumb:
for every Level up a character gains 5 points worth of attributes, where a point equals either 5~HP/MP or 1~STR/DEF/MAG/RES.
\pagebreak
AGI should generally stay between 1 and 5, but monsters with low AGI should make up in other aspects.  
Unlike characters, monsters can also significantly vary in size, which can have a great effect on the battle.
Although monsters do not use traditional weapons and armor, they have equivalent parts integrated into their bodies, that follow the same rules.

\item[\color{accent} Abilities:]
Monsters can also use Magic and Techs, as well Passive and Reaction abilities.
However, aim to keep the number of monster abilities to a minimum, to allow for quick decisions during combat.
Nevertheless, feel free to give monsters access to unique and exotic abilities to make them more interesting. 

\item[\color{accent} Resiliences \& Weaknesses:]
You can add more strategic depth to a monster by utilizing resiliences and weaknesses to specific damage types.
Usually lower Level monsters tend to have more weaknesses, while stronger monster are often resilient against damage types.
Unlike characters, monsters may also be inherently immune to various status effects and damage types.
During combat, you can give subtle hints to the players about the resiliences and weaknesses of an enemy when narrating the combat actions and their effects.

\item[\color{accent} Humanoids:]
If you want to create a humanoid enemy, follow the character rules in the \hyperlink{char}{Characters section}.
Depending on the importance of the enemy, you can omit details that you feel are unnecessary.	
Only for major antagonists, it is worthwhile to fill out an entire character sheet.
Also consider that humanoid enemies can make use of and upgrade equipment and items just like the player characters.

\subsubsection*{Examples}
In the following, some examples of monsters are given that might be encountered in your world.
The Level of a monster vaguely indicates the Level the party should be to fight it.
Furthermore, monsters drop Gil upon defeat, which you may substitute with equipment, items or materials of similar value.
These rewards are evenly divided among the adventurers after each successful battle.
Monsters are classified in size as Medium~(\textbf{M}) if they take up roughly 1u in diameter, as Large~(\textbf{L}) if they take up more than 2u and as Small~(\textbf{S}) if they take up less than 0.5u when viewed from above.
All monsters with a purple box instead of a red one are potentially friendly towards the party and will not attack unless provoked.
You can use the monsters in this chapter as given, but you are also encouraged to make changes to them or use them as examples to create your own.
Therefore, the next page is made up of templates that you can use the create your own monsters.
