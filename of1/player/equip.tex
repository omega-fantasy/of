Combat potency can be further improved through \hypertarget{equip}{equipment}. 
While \textbf{weapons} increase the damage dealt, \textbf{armor} protects against incoming damage.
\textbf{Accessories} are miscellaneous pieces that can complement a character's gear.
In addition, all equipment pieces may provide boosts to attributes or other useful effects. 
Every character can wear one weapon, one armor and two accessories. 
Accessories can be worn by everyone, but characters can only equip specific weapon and armor types depending on their job.
Furthermore, characters can use \textbf{Items}, that provide quick benefits in and outside of combat, but are consumed after a single use.
All items and unequipped possessions are stored in your character's \textbf{Inventory}.

\subsubsection*{Trading}
Equipment and items can be looted from defeated foes and treasure chests or earned as rewards for completing a given task. 
But often the party will need to buy or sell specific things from shops and merchants. 
The currency used for trading is called \textbf{Gil} and typically comes in the form of coins.
You can try buying and selling almost anything, as long as someone is willing to trade.

\example{Trading}{
Terra and her party visit an auction house to bet on rare items.
Today is their lucky day, the item up for bid is a talking \hyperlink{chocobo}{Chocobo}! 
The party is impressed by this talented creature and decides to bid all of their savings, a total of 10000 Gil!
At first it looks like they are outbidding everyone, but in the last second a loving father bids 500000 Gil and acquires the Chocobo as a present for his son.
Maybe the party has better luck (or more money) next time...

\subsubsection*{Upgrading Equipment}
Weapons and armor can be upgraded to higher Levels to become even more potent.
All equipment pieces start at Level 1 and upgrading them at leasts takes an amount Gil and multiple hours of work.
The GM may enforce additional restrictions on upgrades, such as requiring specific materials or expertise to complete them.
Non-player characters may also upgrade equipment and accordingly higher Level pieces may be found in your world.
An upgraded weapon or armor keeps its special effects, increases in potency and may also change its name or appearance as decided by the upgrader.
There are special rules for some equipment types which are explained in \textbf{notes} in the following.
The tables below shows the costs and effects of upgrading weapons and armor to different Levels.  \\

\subsubsection*{Legendary Equipment}
Apart from normal weapons and armor, there is a special class of equipment that may or may not exist in your world called the \hyperlink{leq}{Legendary Equipment}.
These are extraordinarily powerful weapons and armor with great relevance and accordingly tremendous effort is required to find them.
Legendary Equipment pieces are always unique and cannot be upgraded or upgraded to.

\subsubsection*{Examples}
In the following, some typical equipment pieces and items are shown. 
All weapons have a range of 1u by default.
All Level~1 weapons and armor have a default value of 500 Gil, except for parts that have no unique effects (e.g. \hyperlink{mknife}{Mythril Sword}), which are only worth half as much.
The given lists are not exhaustive and the GM is encouraged to make changes and additions to them.
Usually, the party starts the game with basic equipment (e.g. \hyperlink{mknife}{Mythril Sword}), items (e.g. \hyperlink{item}{Potion}) and some Gil. 
Instead of armor, characters may also wear ordinary clothes which only provide DEF~+1 and cannot be upgraded.
