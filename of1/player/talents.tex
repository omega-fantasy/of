Talents are non-combat related skills that a character is especially proficient with.
Every character starts the game with one talent and acquires a second one at \textbf{Level~6}, through his or her newly made experiences.
The GM may also allow characters to gain additional Talents under special circumstances.
Below, some Talents are shown that can be used as given, but the GM may also allow players to create their own Talents by using the given ones as examples. \\
