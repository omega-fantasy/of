Your character's Job determines his or her combat proficiencies including abilities, attributes and equipment expertise.
A character's combat prowess increases further as he or she specializes in a job by gaining experience and Levels.
All available jobs are detailed in their \textbf{Job descriptions} right after this page.
We recommend that you print or copy the description of your chosen Job to use as the second page of your character sheet.
Your character's attributes initially all start at 0 and increase by progressing in a job.
The \textbf{Basic Attributes} table shows your character's attribute gains and equipment expertise at Level~1.
The \textbf{Abilities} table shows which spells and techniques your character learns at different Levels.

\subsubsection*{Archetype}
When your character reaches \textbf{Level~4} in his or her Job, you have to decide between one of its two Archetypes. 
Archetypes represent play styles within a job and can be regarded as taking different approaches to fulfil the same role.
They emphasize progress in different aspects of combat by supporting a character's abilities through passive benefits. 
At Level~4, the chosen archetype grants your character \hyperlink{sabilities}{Passive and Reaction} abilities and also determines the attribute progression at further Levels.

\subsubsection*{Limit Break}
Starting at \textbf{Level 5} you can choose any of your character's known abilities to become their Limit Break, which is an enhanced version of the original ability.
You can only change the Limit Break to another ability during Level up and you can still use the chosen ability in its original version.
When you use the Limit Break ability, it costs twice the amount of MP as usual and gains \textbf{one of the following} additional effects of your choice:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]  
	\item The amount of damage dealt or HP restored by the original ability is doubled.
	\item If the original ability targets a single entity, you can target two entities within its range. If the ability targets an area, the target distance  is doubled.
	\item If the original ability has an effect that lasts for a duration, the duration is doubled.	
	\item If the original ability requires you or the target to pass a check, you can increase or decrease the DC by 2 depending on which benefits you.	
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Job Change}
You can change your character's job only once during the adventure after reaching a Level up.
Instead of increasing the Level of his or her old job, your character starts at Level~1 in the new job.
When changing your character's job, he or she keeps all of the learned abilities, attribute improvements and equipment expertise from the old job.  
The only exception to this is the AGI attribute, where your character only gains the higher bonus between the two jobs.
However, your character can only have a total maximum of 10 Levels between both jobs.
Accordingly, the flexibility of changing jobs comes at the cost of not being able to become an expert in either one.

\example{Job Change}{
After fighting through the Wind Shrine and reaching its top, Bartz and his party realize that the Wind Crystal has already been destroyed.
Regardless, the GM awards the party with a Level Up and everyone in the party except Bartz advances from Level 2 to 3.
Bartz picks up one of the crystal shards and suddenly feels a rush of energy, which imbues him with magical powers.
Instead of leveling up, he changes his job into Black Mage, starting at Level 1.
Nevertheless, he keeps his attributes and the ability to equip swords and armor from his old Warrior job.
In addition, his attributes	are increased as noted in the job description for Level 1 Black Mages.
The only exception is the AGI attribute, which he keeps from its old job since it is higher.
Bartz also learns the spells "Fire", "Ice" and "Lightning" in addition to the "Rush" and "Beatdown" Techs that he already knows.
