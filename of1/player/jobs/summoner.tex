Summoners are powerful spellcasters that can summon magical beasts to aid them in combat. 
They create a strong bond to their summon allowing the summoner to control their incredible powers to his
will. 
While the summoners themselves focus on using defensive magic, their summons can wreak havoc unlike any human being.
