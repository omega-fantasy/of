Thieves are extremely mobile melee fighters, who can quickly traverse the battlefield and are difficult
to hit with physical attacks. 
They excel at "borrowing" items and money from enemies and have a heightened sense for worthwhile business. 
One would be advised to be careful when dealing with a Thief, they always have one more trick up their
sleeve than you would expect.
