\accf{Chocobos} are large, flightless avian creatures with yellow feathers and a long neck.
They are very intelligent and even understand humanoid languages to some degree.
Therefore, Chocobos are often domesticated and used as mounts, making them comparable to horses and renting out Chocobos is a lucrative business for farmers.
Although prices may fluctuate, the party can usually rent a Chocobo for about 10G per day.
In rare cases, farmers also sell Chocobo at extremely expensive prices, starting at around 3000G. 
Alternatively, the party can try to catch Chocobos that roam in the wild, they can usually be found in forests or wide grasslands.
Such Chocobos generally consider them to be hostile by default and engage in combat when feeling threatened.
When taking any damage, a wild Chocobo performs a DC~7 check and upon failure it becomes scared and flees as quickly as possible.
A character can gain its trust by using their action to feed it a Chocobo's favorite food, the \accf{Gysahl Greens}.
In this case, the player performs a check with a DC of 6 + the Chocobo's Level and if successful, it will join the party and follow his or her command from now on.

As most avian creatures, Chocobos lay eggs from which their babies hatch.
However, they grow surprisingly quickly: an egg hatches a few weeks after it is laid and after another month, 
most Chocobos are already as large as their owner.  
They are usually bred in stables, where they can be kept in a warm and safe environment.
Chocobos can be of different types, which is determined by the color of their feathers.
The most common one is the yellow Chocobo, other types are rather rare compared to it.
A Chocobo's type depends on its parents and the following table shows the outcome of different pairings.
In all cases that are not listed, a Chocobo has its parents' type if they are both the same and it is yellow otherwise.\\\\

This knowledge is available at many experienced Chocobo breeders or in books about the topic.
The party can try to breed some of the rare types, which often come with special abilities.
Details about the different Chocobo types are shown at the end of this subsection.
In some cases a newly born Chocobo's type might not adhere to the table above.
Whenever a new Chocobo is born, make a DC 11 check and if you succeed, its type is instead determined as follows:
roll 2d, the Chocobo is white on 2-3, blue on 4-5, yellow on 6-8, red on 9-10, black on 11-12.

Raising a Chocobo is not a simple task, as they require a lot of care and attention.
In return, a Chocobo can the help the party in various ways through their unique capabilities, which improve throughout the adventure.
As such, the current experience of a Chocobo is tracked through its Level, the same way as for player characters. 
However, Level ups are performed slightly differently for Chocobos.
Firstly, a Chocobo can only learn a pre-determined set of abilities depending on its type.
Secondly, the attribute increases at Level up are also handled differently for Chocobos:
their maximum HP and MP increase both by 5 at each Level up. 
In addition, its owner can spend an additional 3 points to further improve the Chocobo's attributes as desired.
The table below shows how many points need to be spent for different attribute bonuses.
A final noteworthy difference compared to player characters is that Chocobos posses the additional \accf{Stamina~(STA)} attribute, which determines their affinity for long distance travel.

Characters can ride Chocobos for a fast and comfortable travel experience.
Riding domesticated ones is simple, but a more experienced rider may come out ahead in sticky situations.
They can carry a reasonable amount of weight without being affected.
Nevertheless, Chocobos get tired after too much uninterrupted travel time.
A Chocobo can walk an amount of hours equal to its Stamina attribute before it needs a break.
This time is halved, if the carried total weight significantly exceeds that of two average humans.
Even though Chocobos usually follow their owner's orders, they might refuse to keep going whenever they are particularly scared or caught by surprise.
Chocobos can also be very capable combatants and thus crucial additions to the party line-up.
They can fight alongside the party, in which case they are treated as any other allied combat participant.
A Chocobo is controlled by the player whose character is its owner and it obeys their commands.
Alternatively, characters can also decide to stay mounted on their Chocobo during combat.
If they do so, the Chocobo and its owner always take their turn together, where only the Chocobo handles the movement. 
Whenever the rider Attacks a small or medium sized enemy while mounted, the target has Disadvantage on the evasion check.
However, when the Chocobo suffers damage while carrying a rider, it has to make a check with a DC of 12 minus its STR attribute. 
If it fails this check, the rider is thrown off and suffers Immobile for 1 round.
