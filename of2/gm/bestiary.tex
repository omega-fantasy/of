One of the most complex aspects of being a GM is the creation of \accf{combat encounters} that are interesting and enjoyable for everyone in your group.
They can occur in many different situations, for example, the party might just try to drive away a gang of bandits or they might face their main antagonist in an epic showdown.
Combat is a matter of life and death and it can take up a significant portion of your playtime.
However, it does not always have to be an fight till death, but the party may seek out alternative resolutions such as negotiation or escape.
During combat, you as the GM take the role of all adversaries and the regular combat rules apply to them, but you may keep some crucial information secret, such as attributes and dice rolls of enemies.
While playing as an enemy party, try to make decisions from their perspective without using your own knowledge.
In addition, it is also helpful to use visual aids like maps to keep track of the battlefield.
In most adventures, the \accf{rewards} received from combat encounters make up a major portion of the party's total wealth.
A party with insufficient Gil cannot afford essential items and equipment, but one with too much money can avoid too many consequences.
The table below provides a rough guideline for the rewards of a combat encounter.
Note that rewards do not always have be in Gil, but can also be equipment, items or materials of similar value and by default they are divided between all party members.

The difficulty of combat encounters can vary greatly and you can tune it depending on the context and your group's preferences.
On the one hand, combat is the most common cause of character death, so we recommend some caution to avoid unexpected surprises.  
On the other hand, you usually want combat to be a respectable challenge for the party to make it worth your time.
Finding a pleasant balance might take some effort, because the difficulty of an encounter depends on a many factors:
first, the circumstances of a battle can heavily tip the scale.
For example, the players will be at a strong disadvantage when they have already suffered through other battles on the same day or when the other side gains a surprise round.
Furthermore, the composition and preparation of both parties has a great effect on the outcome.
For example, a party consisting only of melee fighters will have no issues with ordinary enemies, but will likely struggle against ones with ranged damage and Status Effects.
Finally, the experience of your group will also have a great impact.
For example, players who are new to the game are likely to miss opportunities, while ones with a lot of experience often have unexpected tricks up their sleeves.
All in all, we unfortunately cannot name any strict rules that apply to all groups and situations.
Nevertheless, we will discuss some rough guidelines and rules-of-thumb that you can take into consideration.
Note that we generally err on the side of caution with advice and prepared content and you are encouraged to modify them in case they do not provide you with sufficient challenge. 
%
\ofpar
%
When structuring an enemy party, we generally recommend to have similar participant counts on each side where each enemy is roughly equal in strength to a player character.
Large hordes of weaker enemies will often overwhelm the party, while lone ones rarely stand a chance.
A balanced setup ensures that two important resources are roughly equal: the number and strength of combat actions on both sides.
To gauge the strength of an enemy, we use Levels that we can compare against that of player characters.
For example if the player party consists of four Level 4 characters, the opposing party should contain an equal amount of enemies with the same Level.
As a next step, you can use the following guideline to determine their attributes: 
for every Level, an enemy gains 6 \accf{Attribute Points}, where each point is equal to maximum HP/MP~+5 or STR/MAG/DEF/RES~+1.
Their AGI should usually range between 1 and 4, otherwise regular Attacks will become very ineffective.
Just like characters, enemies can use Magic and Techs, as well Passive and Reaction abilities.
However, we recommend keep the number of enemy abilities low to allow for quick decisions during combat.
Still, you can feel free to give them access to unique and exotic abilities.
We consider any equipment in the total attributes of an enemy and for weapons we assign the DMG of the equipment rank appropriate to the enemy's Level.
You can also add more depth to enemies by assigning elemental resiliences and weaknesses or status effect immunities.
During combat, you can give subtle hints about these specialties to the players when narrating combat actions and their effects.
%
\vfill
%
In some cases, it can be more interesting to create an opposing party that is unbalanced in participant count or strength.
For example, you might want the party to face a horde of weaker enemies or a singular strong enemy, a so-called \accf{Boss}.
Accordingly, in those cases, the strength and Levels of enemies will differ from those of the player characters.
We recommend to use the following guideline to retain the balance:\ofrow
\accf{The sum of Levels on both sides should be roughly equal.}\ofrow
Apart from increased attributes, \accf{Boss Traits} can help your Bosses to make up for their lack of numbers.
Boss Traits are particularly strong special abilities that grant enemies additional actions and durability. 
Every Boss Trait is roughly equal to two Levels, therefore you can use the following rule-of-thumb to determine a Boss's Level:\ofrow
\accf{Level\hfill=\hfill Attribute Points / 6\hfill+\hfill2 x Number of Boss Traits}\ofrow
So when creating an enemy, you can increase their attributes and equip them with Boss traits to reach the desired enemy Level.
A list of possible Boss Traits is shown on the right hand side.
%
\vfill
%
The following types of irregularly balanced enemy party setups are commonly used:
\ofrow
\accf{Single Boss:}
A lone powerful enemy, this could for example be the main antagonist. 
In this case, we recommend to prefer Boss Traits to extreme attributes for reaching the desired enemy Level.
A single Boss also greatly benefits from additional specialties, such as special interactions with the environment.
This variant is the hardest balance, so we recommend to prefer other ones when possible.
\ofrow
\accf{Council Boss:} 
The enemy party consists of a small group of Bosses, usually 2 or 3.
Each of them is equally strong, but stronger than a player character.
Usually, their strengths complement each other, for example, one Boss might be focused on offense while the other excels at healing.
\ofrow
\accf{Boss with Minions:} 
This boss has several regular enemies working with them, for example a Necromancer raising her undead hordes. 
In this case, the Boss has a higher Level than the party while the minions have a lower one.
\ofrow
\accf{Multi-Part Boss:} 
This type of boss is represented by multiple parts.
Each part is built as one enemy with its own turn, attributes and abilities, but all parts can only move together at once.
Usually, one of the parts acts as the core, when it dies, all other parts die with it.
The core usually also has additional protection and the ability to regenerate other parts, once they suffer KO.
\ofrow
\accf{Enemy Horde:} 
A large group of regular enemies, usually each with the same type and a lower Level than a player character.  
However, we advise against outnumbering the party more than 2 to 1, for example if you have 4 players, they should not face more than 8 enemies at once.

Apart from non-player characters, \accf{Monsters} are another common type of adversary that the party may face in combat. 
Monsters are wild beings that live in their natural habitats, upon contact with the party they usually feel threatened and attack.
Different types of monsters often work together against hostiles and the party might come across more powerful and intelligent monsters with complex goals.
They are often part or cause of major conflicts and thus your adventure may feature various monsters at the center of its plot. 
Compared to characters, monsters can also vary greatly in size and appearance.
They are classified as Medium~(\accf{M}) if they take up roughly 1u in diameter, as Large~(\accf{L}) if they take up more than 2u and as Small~(\accf{S}) if they take up less than 0.5u when viewed from above.
Monsters do not use regular weapons and armor, but they have equivalent parts integrated into their bodies, that follow the same rules.
The following pages include various prepared monsters of different Levels.
You may use them as given, but we also encourage you to modify them to suite your needs or use them as examples for creating your own.
