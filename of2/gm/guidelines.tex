Compared to the players, who play the game from the perspective of the protagonists, the \accf{Game Master} has a different role.
He creates the world and setting of the adventure and takes the role of all non-player characters.
Furthermore, the GM describes the environment and narrates the outcomes of most actions. 
Unlike the players, the GM is not bound by strict rules and may make his own rulings when necessary.
There is no single way to be a successful GM and we encourage you adopt a style that is enjoyable for both you and the players.

Accordingly, this chapter does not focus on presenting rules or advice.
Instead, it is a collection of modular \accf{supplements}, that you can either use directly or regard as examples for creating your own content.
These supplements not only to give a glimpse into the various aspects of game mastering, but also show some of the different directions that you can take with Omega Fantasy. 
The present modules can be broadly split into two categories: \accf{prepared content} and \accf{rule changes}.
The former provide you with world building blocks such as adventures, settings and monsters that are self-contained and extensible.
The latter present you examples to customize the rules to your preferences.
While the prepared content is well suited for beginners, we recommend to consider rule changes once you have gathered some experience with Omega Fantasy.
All available supplements are listed in the following, together with a short synopsis for each one.
