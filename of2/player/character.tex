Every player creates a character who is a protagonist in the game world created by the GM.
To create a Level 1 character, copy or print the \accf{Character Sheet} on the next page.

Your character's \accf{Job} determines his or her combat proficiency and progression including abilities, attributes and equipment expertise.
All available Jobs are detailed in their Job descriptions right after the character sheets.
You can print or copy the description of your chosen Job to use as the second page of your character sheet.
Your character's attributes are initially 0 and increase by starting and progressing in a job.

\ofboxwithtitle{Example: Character Creation}
{
We create a character named Vaan, who is a 17-year old, blonde human boy with athletic appearance. 
Vaan is an orphan, who gets by in the big city by stealing and often acts as a father figure to other orphans.
He dreams of owning an airship and being a sky pirate one day. 
We communicate with the GM to make sure that Vaan fits well enough with the given setting and the rest of the party.
%Then, we choose the Leading Man talent and the Thief job, which seem to fit Vaan best.
From the attributes table of the job we determine Vaan's maximum HP~(20), maximum MP~(19) and AGI (4), all other attributes start at 0.
We also note that he learns the Steal tech.
Finally, from our initial 1500 Gil, we buy a Mythril Knife, Myhtril Vest, a Phoenix Down and 2 Potions, which leaves us with 300 Gil extra.
