Every player creates a \accf{Character} who is a protagonist in the game world created by the GM.
To create a Level~1 character, copy or print the \accf{Character Sheet} on the next page.
It allows you track various aspects about your character and there is an example of a filled out sheet, that you can use as a guideline.
Choose your character's \accf{Name} and give a short description of him or her.
Briefly summarize your character's \accf{Story} and explain his or her motivation for joining the party, considering that this is most likely his or her first serious adventure.
Then choose a \accf{Job} for your character as explained below. 
Finally, the \accf{Equipment} subsection explains how you can customize your character's starting equipment.
The table on the right summarizes the benefits gained at further Levels, all of which are explained in detail within this section.

Your character's \accf{Job} determines his or her combat proficiency including abilities, attributes and equipment expertise.
All available Jobs are detailed in their Job descriptions right after the character sheets.
Print or copy the description of your chosen Job to use as the second page of your character sheet.
Your character's attributes are initially 0 and increase by progressing in a job.
The job description shows the attributes and abilities gained at each Level as well as the types of equipment your character can use.
When your character reaches Level~3, you have to decide between one of the job's two \accf{Archetypes}. 
Archetypes represent different specializations of a Job and provide additional abilities and attributes.

\ofboxwithtitle{Example: Character Creation}
{
	We create a character named Vaan, who is a 17-year old, blonde human boy with athletic appearance. 
	Vaan is an orphan, who gets by in the big city by stealing and often acts as a father figure to other orphans.
	He dreams of owning an airship and being a sky pirate one day.
	From the attributes table of the job we determine Vaan's maximum HP~(20), maximum MP~(19) and AGI (4), all other attributes start at 0.
	We also note that he learns the Steal tech.
	Finally, from our initial 1500G, we buy a Mythril Knife, Myhtril Vest, a Phoenix Down and 2 Potions, which leaves us with 300G extra.
