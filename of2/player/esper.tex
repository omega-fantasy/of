\accf{Summons}, also known as Espers or Eidolons, are extraordinarily powerful magical beings that exist beyond the realm of humans and monsters.
They reside within their own plane of existence, but can manifest themselves in the real world when necessary.
In rare cases, when a Summon is impressed by an outstanding mortal, it will lend its powers to aid his or her cause.
When reaching \accf{Level~5} each player chooses one Summon that bonds with their character.
The bond grants a permanently available supportive effect, as well as a summon ability that can be activated using an action in combat. 
All summon abilities have a cast time of 1 round and cost 10\% of your current HP and MP to use.
However, this cost cannot fall below a minimum of 1 HP and 1 MP.
All available Summons are listed below.
