\accf{Espers}, sometimes also called Eidolons, are extraordinary magical beings that exist beyond the realm of humans.
However, they can manifest themselves in the real world for short periods of time.
When an Esper is impressed by an outstanding mortal, it will lend its powers to aid his or her cause.
When reaching \accf{Level~5} each player chooses one Esper that bonds with their character.
Note that these Esper bonds act independently of the ones granted by the Summoner job.
An Esper bond grants a permanent Support effect, as well as a Call ability that can be activated in combat with an action. 
You can use each Call ability only once per battle, but without any cost or cast time and all damage dealt by Calls ignores the targets' DEF and RES.
All Espers are listed below.
