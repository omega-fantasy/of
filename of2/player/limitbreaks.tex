In clutch situations, heroes can push beyond their usual limits to unleash incredibly powerful abilities called \accf{Limit Breaks}.
When player characters reach \accf{Level~4}, they can create their unique Limit Break ability.
To use a Limit Break, characters have to gather 10 \accf{Limit Points~(LP)} as a prerequisite, which are consumed upon activating a Limit Break.
Every player also chooses a \accf{Limit Mode} to decide under which circumstances their character gains Limit Points, but they can never have more than 10 Limit Points.
All available Limit Modes, their conditions and how much Limit Points you receive by fulfilling the condition, are shown on the next page.
Alternatively, the GM may allow players to create their own Limit Mode conditions by assigning the amount of LP gained when it is fulfilled. 
The chosen Limit Break ability and the Limit Mode can be changed on every subsequent Level Up.

\ofboxwithtitle{Example: Limit Points}{
	Vivi and his friends are traveling on an airship, when suddenly a hostile mage named Black Waltz descends on the deck.
	The fiend immediately inflicts KO to 5 passengers using a powerful lightning spell.
	Vivi has currently selected the Avenger Limit Mode, so he immediately gains 10 Limit Points as he watches this incident. 
	He vows to take revenge and engages in combat with Black Waltz.
	Vivi activates his Limit Break Trance, which empties his Limit Bar and temporarily grants him powerful combat benefits.
	The Limit Break gives Vivi and his party a much needed edge in the ensuing battle which ultimately allows them to defeat their mighty adversary.

\ofbullet{3 LP after successfully finishing a combat encounter.}
\ofbullet{3 LP after waking up from sleep.}
\ofbullet{5 LP after using a Talent.}
\ofbullet{10 LP after an ally suffers KO and you are the only one in the party who is not suffering KO.}
\ofbullet{10 LP after Leveling up.}
\ofbullet{The GM is encouraged to award additional LP whenever a player character performs a particularly heroic or outstanding feat or whenenever the party completes a major task or quest.}

Limit Breaks are used in the same way as Magic and Techs, but they always have no MP cost or cast time.
You can start creating your unique Limit Break by choosing any of your known spells or techs as its basis.
Then, you can add a set of improvements and effects to turn the chosen ability into a Limit Break.
Each additional effect increases the \accf{Rating~(RTG)} of your Limit Break and this Rating cannot exceed 5 points.
However, there is no benefit to staying below this cap.
Finally, you should choose a new name for your Limit Break and try to visualize what it looks like when its effect is activated.
All possible improvements that you can use to create your Limit Break together their Rating costs are listed on the next page.
You cannot pick the same improvement more than once, but the GM may allow other improvements than the ones listed below by assigning them a Rating cost.

\ofboxwithtitle{Example: Limit Breaks}{
	Cloud, who has the Warrior job, reaches Level 4, so he can create his own Limit Break.
	He chooses his Beatdown ability as its basis, which allows its user to make an Attack with low accuracy that always grants a Critical Hit if successful.
	Cloud chooses the following improvements to create a Limit Break with a rating of 5:
	\ofbullet{Move up to 3u before or after using ability.}
	\ofbullet{Attacks made during ability cannot be evaded.}
	\ofbullet{Damage dealt ignores the targets' DEF and RES.}
	Therefore, the new ability allows him to reposition himself and then perform a guaranteed Critical Hit that ignores the target's DEF and RES.
	Being a Limit Break it also has no MP cost or cast time.
	Cloud chooses the name Braver for his Limit Break and describes its use as follows: 
	you run towards the target and right before you reach him, you jump into the air to perform a powerful strike downwards.
