A character's combat potency can be further improved through \accf{Equipment}.
While \accf{Weapons} increase the damage dealt, \accf{Armor} protects against incoming damage and \accf{Accessories} can complement a character's gear.
Each equipment piece provides a \accf{Unique} effect and weapons and armor have an additional \accf{Type} effect determined by their type.
All weapons have a range of 1u unless specified otherwise. 
Instead of armor, characters can also wear regular clothes which only provide DEF~+1.
Accessories can be worn by everyone, but characters can only equip specific weapon and armor types depending on their job.
However, all characters can use \accf{Items}, that provide quick benefits in and outside of combat, but are consumed after a single use.
Equipment pieces are classified into different \accf{Equipment Classes} depending on their potency and rarity.
While everyone can carry Beginner equipment, characters need to reach higher Levels to use Advanced and Expert equipment.
The details of each equipment class are shown in the table below.

All items and unequipped possessions are stored in your character's \accf{Inventory}.
Equipment and items can be looted from defeated foes and treasure chests or earned as rewards for completing a given task. 
But the party may also buy or sell specific goods to shops and merchants. 
The currency used for trading is called \accf{Gil} (shortened \accf{G}) and typically comes in the form of golden coins.
You can try buying and selling almost anything, as long as someone is willing to trade.

\ofboxwithtitle{Example: Trading}{
	Terra and her party visit an auction house to bet on rare items.
	Today is their lucky day, the item up for bid is a talking Chocobo! 
	The party is impressed by this talented creature and decides to bid all of their savings, a total of 10000G!
	It looks like they are outbidding everyone, but in the last second a loving father bids 500000G and acquires the Chocobo as a present for his son.
	Maybe the party has better luck (or more money) next time...

Weapons and armor can be improved through the use of \accf{Materia}.
Materia usually appear as crystal-like artifacts that concentrate magical forces to be used by anyone.
They can be slotted into weapons and armor to grant their wielder additional effects.
Slotted Materia can also be removed, swapped and stored easily. 
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, every weapon or armor can carry one Materia, but clothes and accessories cannot carry any.
Materia can be divided into two categories: command and support Materia.
Command materia allow the wielder of the imbued equipment to use new abilities, while support Materia grant passive effects.
If a Materia allows the use of an existing ability, the user has to adhere to its usual rules including MP cost and cast time.
Finally, some Materia can only be slotted into weapons, while others are only compatible with armor.

Unless the GM decides otherwise, every character gains 1500G at Level~1, from which they can buy their starting equipment as follows:
\ofrow
\ofbullet{Buy any Beginner weapon for 500G or a Beginner Myhtril weapon for 250G.}
\ofbullet{Buy any Beginner armor for 500G, a Beginner Myhtril armor for 250G, or clothes for 100G.}
\ofbullet{Optionally, buy any set of Items that you can afford.}
\ofbullet{Optionally, buy one Beginner accessory for 500G.}
\ofbullet{Optionally, buy one Materia that you can afford.}
The following pages give various examples of equipment pieces that you can choose.
The tables detail the unique effect of each equipment piece, as well as the type effects of each weapon and armor type.
All listed weapons and armor are of Beginner class unless the GM explicitly decides otherwise.
Note that your character sheet provides various fields to keep track of your inventory as well as your currently equipment pieces with all their effects.
