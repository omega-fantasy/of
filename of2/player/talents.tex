\ofboxwithtitle{Example: Talents}
{
	Kefka leads the army of the Gestahlian empire in a siege on Doma Castle, who are accused of supporting rebel groups.
	Their first attempt at a frontal attack fails spectacularly.
	The castle is well fortified and led by a powerful soldier named Cyan.
	Kefka devises a vicious plan to secure victory: 
	he uses his Clown Talent to create a powerful liquid poison that leaves no trace.
	Despite protest among his allies, he pours the poison into Doma's water supply, resulting in the death of most its population.
	Although Cyan survives, Doma is severely weakened and the Gestahlian army is able to take the castle with ease.
