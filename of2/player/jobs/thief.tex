	\accf{Thieves} are mobile melee fighters, who can quickly traverse the battlefield and are difficult
	to hit with physical attacks. 
	They excel at "borrowing" items and money from enemies and have a heightened sense for worthwhile business. 
%	One would be advised to be careful when dealing with a Thief, they always have one more trick up their
%	sleeve than you would expect.
