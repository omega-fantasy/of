	\accf{Monks} are adept melee fighters that posses a deadly combination of strength and technique.
	While they do not have expertise in using magic, Monks can produce similarly incredible effects by tapping into their inner life force. 
	A skilled monk absorbs what is useful, discards what is useless and adds what is specifically his own.
