		They are dismissed when they suffer KO, when you summon again or when you dismiss them.
		The HP \& MP of a summon is the same as when it was dismissed, if it suffered KO, it is summoned with 1 HP.
		Summons fully recover their HP \& MP when you go to sleep.
		They level up with you where gain the same attribute increases as you.
