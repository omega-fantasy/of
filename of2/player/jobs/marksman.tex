	\accf{Marksmen} are experts of all kinds of ranged weapons that strike from great distance. 
	Skilled Marksmen can see through their enemies, allowing them to know a target's strengths and weaknesses. 
	Therefore they can not only deal significant ranged damage, but also disable enemies with special techniques.
