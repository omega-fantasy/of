\ofsection{FFRPG 4e rules}
%
The following is a collection of optional rules and content for the Final Fantasy Role Playing Game 4th Edition~ \textbf{(FFRPG 4e)}, which you can use to create a closer feeling to Final Fantasy Tactics.
%
\\\\
%
\ofaccent{\large Optional Map Combat Rules} \ofrow
Groups willing to experience an even more detailed combat system may use this optional mode for some or even all of its combat encounters. 
Use this optional system to simulate the strategy elements of the original Final Fantasy Tactics game. 
Be wary, however, that this implies a genre change and will place even more focus on the combat aspect of the game.
%
\ofrow
%
\ofaccent{The MOVE stat:} Add the \textbf{MOVE} stat for each character. 
It means the total number of squares the character may move with the \textbf{!Move} action. 
All characters start with a MOVE stat of 4, increasing by 1 for each 6 levels of the Air stat. Abilities and Statuses may affect the MOVE stat.\\
\ofaccent{Weaken (Speed):} Move reduced by 1.\\
\ofaccent{Strengthen (Speed):} Move increased by 1.\\
\ofaccent{Toad:} Move reduced to 1.\\
\ofaccent{Berserk:} The character will move as close as possible to the nearest target within their line of sight before attacking, if able.\\
\ofaccent{Confuse:} Roll for confuse as normal; randomly pick a target that is within reach in accordance with the confuse roll. 
If this is not possible, decide radomly a cardinal direction, and then move as far as possible in that direction.\\
\ofaccent{Float:} The character is less hampered by harsh terrain.\\
\ofaccent{Flying:} Ignore all terrain while moving.\\
\ofaccent{Immobilize:} Move reduced to zero.\\
\ofaccent{Stone:} The character, as implied by the text, cannot move or act.\\
\ofaccent{Sleep:} The character, as implied by the text, cannot move or act.\\
\ofaccent{Stop:} The character, as implied by the text, cannot move or act.
%
\\\\
%
\ofaccent{New Basic Action - !Move:} All characters gain the \textbf{!Move} action.
You may use an action to move a number of squares up to your MOVE stat. 
Once per round, when doing any action (but not during a reaction) you may also use the \textbf{!Move} action as a free action. 
If you do so, you can move either before or after doing the action. 
When moving, you walk in orthogonal directions counting one square at a time, so to move in a diagonal path you must spend two squares of movement for each diagonal square you walk (one forward then one to the left/right).
If the target of an ability moves during the windup of a Slow action, the ability remains targeted on them, as long as they remain within range. 
If a target moves outside the range of a Slow action, the character acting may retarget his action to another valid target in range.
A character charging a Slow action can do a \textbf{!Move} action (either as a free action or by using an interrupt or delayed action), and move at the start of the phase before the Slow action is executed.
A character or monster may freely move through any allied space as long as they do not stop in the same space as their ally. 
They cannot move through a square occupied by a foe. 
Whenever you do a successful \textbf{!Flee} action, you may also move a number of squares equal to your Move stat.
%
\\\\
%
\ofaccent{Zone of Control:} Characters wielding Melee weapons, or that can do Melee attacks for any reason (for example, an Archer who has the Point-Blank Specialty wielding a ranged weapon) project Zone of Control.
Your Zone of Control is equal to all squares you can hit with a melee attack. 
Any enemy who tries to leave your \textbf{Zone of Control} must be successful with a \textbf{!Flee} action to do so.
Moving into a Zone of Control or any movement that does not leave a character's Zone of Control is unimpeded.
Forced movement (for example, if someone pushes or pulls a character) also ignores Zone of Control. 
Unarmed attacks do not project Zone of Control, as does any character with a status effect that prevents him from doing actions (\textbf{Sleep}, \textbf{Stop}, \textbf{Stone} and \textbf{Disable}). 
Reduce by 25 the difficulty of using \textbf{!Flee} against a target with the Blind status effect.
%
\\\\
%
\ofaccent{Weapon Range:} Some weapons are able to attack from further away than others. 
The \textbf{Range} is the number of spaces away from the character that they may attack. 
All weapons will also follow a Line of Effect, so should an obstacle or another target be in-between the Character and their chosen target, the attack will instead hit the first obstacle or target in the Line of Effect.\ofrow 
\ofaccent{Light Swords/Knives, Weapons \& Shield, Heavy Weapons, Claws/Gloves, Staves, Twin Blades:} Any square adjacent or directly diagonal to the attacker.\ofrow
\ofaccent{Polearms:} Any square up to 2 squares from the attacker.\ofrow
\ofaccent{Throwing Weapons, Wands, Instruments:} Any square up to four squares from the attacker.\ofrow
\ofaccent{Bows, Rifles/Crossbows:} Any square up to five squares from the attacker. \ofrow
\ofaccent{Shotgun:} Cone: 3.
%
\\\\
%
\ofaccent{Other Ranges:} All other ranges are written using the following notation: "R: Number; E: Number".
R means range and “Number” is the number of squares away from the user where the user can select the target. 
An R rating of zero means the origin square of the effect is the user. 
E means effect and “Number” is the width of the effect, in squares. 
An E rating of zero means the effect targets only one square. 
For other range or effect ratings, see the diagrams below.
The blue square means the origin (either the character for the origin of the Range or the origin square for the origin of
the Effect), while the red squares mean either the squares that may be selected as the origin square (Range) or the squares affected by it (Effect). For Cones and Bursts, the origin square is not under the effects of the spell/ability, unless the ability or spell says otherwise.

\ofaccent{Terrain:} The terrain is categorized in various types.\ofrow
\textbf{Normal Terrain} is the usual terrain fights will take place on. 
It is relatively plain, easy to traverse, and presents no danger to anyone. 
A normal road is a prime example of Normal Terrain. \ofrow
\textbf{Difficult Terrain} is a terrain which does not pose any danger, but is hard to traverse. 
To enter a square of Difficult Terrain, the character must spend an extra Move point. 
Characters under the \textbf{Float} or \textbf{Flight} status effects treat this terrain as if it was Normal Terrain.  
Shallow water, deep snow, ice, shrubs, debris and others may qualify as Difficult Terrain. \ofrow
\textbf{Hazardous Terrain} is a terrain, which is easy to traverse, but poses some danger to the characters. 
When the character enters a square of Hazardous Terrain, it takes damage equal to 10\% of its maximum HP, ignoring Armor and Magic Armor. 
This damage may be either physical or magical, and be of any element, according to the terrain. 
Characters under the \textbf{Float} or \textbf{Flight} status effects treat this terrain as if it was Normal Terrain. Spikes, thorn shrubs, some traps and others may qualify as Hazardous Terrain. \ofrow
\textbf{Deadly Terrain} is a terrain, which is not only hard to traverse but also poses a big danger to the characters. 
When the character enters a square of Deadly Terrain, it takes damage equal to 10\% of its maximum HP, ignoring Armor and Magic Armor, and must spend an extra Move point. 
The character also suffers the same damage for each round he starts in this kind of terrain. Some terrains, at GM’s discretion, may inflict this damage each phase instead of each round. 
This damage may be either physical or magical, and be of any element, according to the terrain. Characters under the \textbf{Float} status effect treat this terrain as if it was Hazardous Terrain, and characters under the \textbf{Flight} status effect treat this terrain as if it was Normal Terrain if they can fly over it. 
Lava, poisonous swamps, some traps and others may qualify as Deadly Terrain. \ofrow
\textbf{Impassable Terrain} is a terrain which you cannot traverse normally.
Characters may not enter squares of Impassable Terrain. 
Characters under the Flight status effect treat this terrain as if it was Normal Terrain if they can fly over it. 
Depending on the nature of the Impassable Terrain, you may be able to jump, climb or swim to reach the other side of it. 
Cliffs, rocks, deep water, tree trunks, walls and others may qualify as Impassable Terrain. 
%
\pagebreak\\
%
\ofaccent{Line of Sight and Line of Effect:} When facing an obstacle, it might be important to check if you have line of sight and line of effect to your target. 
When in doubt, trace a straight line between any point of your square and any point in the target’s square. 
A small string can be very useful to do this. 
If there is at least one line that does not go through two opposite sides of an Impassable Terrain square, you have \textbf{Line of Sight~(LoS)}. 
You can see any characters you have Line of Sight to.
Actions and Spells with E greater than zero hit any square from which the origin square has Line of Sight. \ofrow
To target a character with Attacks and Abilities, you must have Line of Effect.
If there is at least one line that does not go through any two sides of an Impassable Terrain square, you have Line of Effect (LoE) to your target.

\ofaccent{Giant Characters:} Some characters may be greater than one square, occupying all of them at one time. 
For example, a monster may occupy a 2x2 square, a 3x3 square, a 2x1 rectangle or any other shape. 
When moving, giant characters treat all Difficult or Hazardous Terrain as Normal Terrain, unless all squares they occupy are Difficult or Hazardous. Deadly Terrain is treated as Hazardous Terrain for Giant Characters, unless all squares they occupy are Deadly.
Impassable Terrain is treated as Difficult Terrain unless it covers at least one side of the giant character (For example, a 2-square wide wall will block the movement from a 2x2 giant, but not a 3x3 one). A giant traversing Impassable Terrain like this will have to pay 2 points of MOVE per square traversed until none of its squares are over Impassable Terrain.
When determining Line of Sight and Line of Effect to or from giant characters, you may choose any of the character’s squares as the origin or target of the line.
Giant characters are only out of another character’s LoS if all of its squares are outside the LoS. All attacks and spells that can hit at least one square of the giant character hit it. 
Lastly, when determining the range of the giant character’s actions, you may use any of its squares as the origin square.

\ofaccent{Job Adjustments:} Several jobs have to be adjusted to work with the map combat rules. 
You can find the list of adjustments and new specialties for each Job, Action and Spell below. 
All weapon attacks not listed below use your weapon’s range. 
All reactions not listed below can be used whenever you meet its trigger, regardless of range. 
When a Spell or Action lists two different damages, one for single target and other for group target, use the single-target damage when it has only one character in its area of effect, and the group-target damage when it has more than one character in its area of effect.
